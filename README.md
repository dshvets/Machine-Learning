## Machine-Learning
Here you'll find my implementations of some important machine learning methods.  


Method | Explanation
------------- | -------------
K-means | Clustering *n* data points into *k* distinct clusters. User inputs the number of iterations until they want the optimization to end.  
K-Nearest Neighbor | Cell 4 
Silhouette | Cell 3
Cross-Validation | cell 5
